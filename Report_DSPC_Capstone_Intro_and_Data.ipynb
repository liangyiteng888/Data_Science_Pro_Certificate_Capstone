    "A private investor expects to open a grocery store or supermarket through joining the Loblaw franchises in Ontario, Canada.  Loblaw is the top grocery store and supermarket franchising company in Canada that offers various franchise banners to be used for the independently owned franchise stores across Canada. Details of Loblaw franchise business opportunities can be found in this [link](https://www.loblaw.ca/en/careers/franchise-opportunities.html). \n",

    "The private investor wants to open a store at a location where one of the banners from the list could be the best fit. Based on the private investor's description and preference, some other specific criteria should be considered when going through the analysis.\n",
    "1. The best choice of location is Toronto, but still open to other regions in western Ontario including Kitchener-Waterloo-Cambridge (KWC), London, and Windsor.\n",
    "2. The pick of location and banner should be optimized to avoid harsh competitions within the same area.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Through this analysis, multiple appropriate locations with optimized selections of banners should be provided to the private investor to support his decision making. From the result, he should get a clearer and detailed insight of the locations and neighborhood features around them so that he can make the best decision about the business strategy."

    "**The first task** of this project is to figure out what differentiate the banners from each other. One of the straightforward strategies is to analyze the products and brands that each banner provides and find out what types of customer targeted by them. In order to do that, scraping the product and brand list for each banner and spending time on understanding the product-customer relationship is unavoidable. This could be extrodinarily time-consuming, and the return on the investment of time may not be satisfying eventually. However, it can be done from another point of view. Since Loblaw's business has been healthy for many years and its strategy of franchise expanding has been tested working by the real market, we have the confidence to believe that the existing locations of those stores have gone through meticulous determination after tremendous analysis performed by either Loblaw's own business teams or other consulting firms. Therefore, by analyzing the geographical data collected for the neighborhoods around the exsting store locations, we are able to tell the uniqueness of each banner based on the similarities or differences of its neighborhood comparing to others. **The second task** is to analyze multiple regions or cities and try to classify their neighborhoods in such a way that the banners are classified. By doing this, we can propose the top and second choices of banners for each of the neighborhoods in those regions of interest. **The last task**, of course, is to help the private investor avoid potential risk of opening a store with duplicated function as one of the existing stores nearby. Competition with similar banners from other franchise companies than Loblaw is allowable."

    "Locations of stores can usually be found by using the \"store locators\" provided by each store's website.

However, the temporary searched results, as attempted, are not easy to be scraped by Beautifulsoup pakage in the traditional way. Another approach is found and used here, that is, we can use a website scraping software called [Parsehub](https://www.parsehub.com/). It remembers a sequence of selections and clicks needed for searching on the website before scraping the data outputed from the searches. The tutorial can be referred [here](https://www.parsehub.com/blog/how-to-get-the-locations-of-retail-stores-with-web-scraping/).  \n",
